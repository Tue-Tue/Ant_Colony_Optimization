## Introduction:
Our group implement the MMACO (Max-Min Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm, a metaheuristic approach inspired by the behavior of ant colonies in nature. MMACO enhances the basic ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm by incorporating a pheromone value limitation mechanism (max-min), which prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions and improves exploration of the solution space. This project offers an efficient method for finding optimal routes in the ThOP (Traveling Highwayman Orienteering Problem) while allowing parameter customization to adapt to various real-world scenarios.
